Setting up your download folder
===============================

    How to use:
	1. Select a base directory for all downloads, all folders will be prepended
           with this path
           (Both relative and absolute paths are valid.)
	2. Set a download folder, will be created if it does not already exist
	3. Add in optional variables to help organize downloads
           To use a variable simply enter the relevant character preceded by a '%'
           If you want to actually insert the character '%' you need to escape it 
           with a '\', ie "\%"

           Currently available variables:
           ------------------------------
            '%x', = file extension
            '%s', = article subject
            '%n', = file name
            '%g', = newsgroup
            '%p', = file poster
            '%S', = file size
            '%d', = post date
            '%D', = date now
            '%t', = article status ----- NEED 
            '%i'  = name of file imported from
            '%z'  = name of the newzbin file minus msgid_<number> part

    (Note: NZB-O-Matic will default to downloading all files to "\Download". To set this to
           previous versions behavior, the path would be "PathToExe\Download" and folder would
           be "%i")

Needs Group
===========

The NNTP RFC specs are a bit unclear about this, but some servers do not require a 'GROUP'
command before retrieving an article (with 'ARTICLE' or 'BODY') when using message-id's. 

What does this mean? On some NNTP servers, the GROUP command is rather slow, when by-passing
the 'GROUP' command, you can download articles quicker if they come from different groups.

Also, sometimes this will allow you to download articles from groups that your news server 
doesnt carry.

If, after turning off 'Needs Group', you get article errors, you may need to enable 
'Needs Group' again.

Version History
===============
2005 Oct 15 - v0.49
	+ Added option to pause par downloading
	+ Added option to decode all incompletes.

2005 Apr 23 - v0.48
	* Fixed the file association so it will work when installed in a folder with a space
	+ Added a button to set all incompletes back to queued
	+ Added a feature to reconnect if user was disconnected from being idle and user imports a new nzb file
	
2005 Mar 14 - v0.47
	* Fixed the '%z' so that it supports 'msgidlist_uid' files from newzbin as well
	+ Added a '%y' option that is the same as '%z' but it replaces '_' with ' '	
	
2005 Feb 15 - v0.46
	* Fixed the monitor folder option to wait until the file has finished downloading.
	
2005 Feb 10 - v0.45
	+ Added the option to monitor a folder for new NZB files.  In the
	preferences window you can select the folder which you want to monitor.
	Whenever a new nzb file is created in this folder it will automatically be
	imported into NOMP.

2005 Feb 09 - v0.44
	* Fixed bug with importing a nzb file and then having the config files saved in the wrong folder
	* Fixed bug with opening the window from the tray and having it set the window size to 0x0
	* Fixed 'disconnect on idle' so that it saves it to the options file
	+ Changed the import NZB functionality to allow importing multiple .nzb
		files at one time
	+ Added a new download folder option '%z' which can be used for nzb files imported
		from newzbin (msgid_111111_Blah.nzb will become Blah).  If the nzb file
		doesn't follow the msgid_<number> format it will just create the folder
		the same way the '%i' does
	+ Saves the window location now and whether or not the form is maximized
	+ Added option to empty the cache 
	+ Added an attempt at a fix for when you import/delete entries while downloading and the current download stalls
